# Memory Game

### Instructions

To Play: Simply click each "?" box to reveal the tile.

It will show an image of a commonly used Web Browser Icon.

Click another tile to hopefully match the images together.

If you mismatch the tiles, all tiles will be turned faced down again.

When you win the game, an alert "WINNER" will appear, and after confirming the game
will reset after a few moments shuffling the tiles.
